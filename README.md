## Certification Table

This table presents all of the Certifications that are available to take part through Salesforce's site. Each passed Certification has a reward value which are all presented in a table created by this App. The App works as a cheat sheet so Salesforce can read the Reward Value that is associated with a given Certification name.

The button below is still a test.
